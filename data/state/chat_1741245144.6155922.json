{"messages": [{"__type__": "Message", "type": "response", "content": "Unfortunately I do not have enough context to debug the issue you are facing. A few things that may help provide more information:\n\n- What specific command or cell is getting stuck when loading? Providing the exact code or cell that is having issues could help identify where the problem lies.\n\n- Are there any error messages or output when it gets stuck loading? Including any logs, tracebacks, or errors could assist with diagnosing the problem. \n\n- What runtime are you using in Colab (GPU, TPU, etc.)? Different runtimes could exhibit different behaviors.\n\n- Has this worked successfully before or is this a new issue? If it previously worked, noting any changes in versions, environment, or code could help uncover potential regressions.\n\n- Can you try simplifying the code to isolate the problem? Removing parts piece-by-piece may reveal the problematic area.\n\nProviding any additional details along those lines would assist me in providing specific suggestions to debug the loading issue you are encountering. I'm happy to help troubleshoot further with any more context you can provide! Please let me know if any other information would be helpful.", "from_module": "meta_orchestrator", "to_module": "meta_orchestrator", "timestamp": "2025-03-06T09:32:13.390702", "metadata": {"chat_response": true}}], "research_goals": [], "active_modules": ["meta_orchestrator"], "system_logs": [], "configurations": {"llm": {"model": "claude-2.1", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 4096, "api_key": "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"}, "system": {"log_level": "INFO", "max_retries": 3, "timeout": 300, "safety_checks": {"high_risk_operations": true, "user_approval_required": true, "max_concurrent_tasks": 5}}, "modules": {"tool_builder": {"enabled": true, "max_tools": 10, "tool_types": ["search", "calculate", "analyze"]}, "co_scientist": {"enabled": true, "specializations": ["research", "analysis", "writing"]}}, "communication": {"message_timeout": 60, "max_message_size": 1048576, "retry_interval": 5}, "state": {"max_history_size": 1000, "state_cleanup_interval": 3600}, "persistence": {"enabled": true, "storage_path": "C:\\Users\\darel\\3D Objects\\Blender\\o1 (1)\\o1\\data\\state"}}, "metrics": {"requests_processed": 2.0, "errors": 2.0, "average_processing_time": 2.2412158250808716, "successful_responses": 2.0, "module_metrics": {"meta_orchestrator": {"calls": 0, "errors": 0}, "tool_builder": {"calls": 0, "errors": 0}, "co_scientist": {"calls": 0, "errors": 0}}}}
